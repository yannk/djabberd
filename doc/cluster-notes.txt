                     (has a default implementation that connects directly, star topology)

   DJabberd::Cluster::Naive
           find_barejid_locations doing polling the star

   DJabberd::Cluster::LiveJournal
         - override find_barejid_locations w/ database lookup (in subprocess/gearman)
         - keep default start topology delivery

   DJabberd::Cluster::Spread
         - could do both lookup and delivery w/ spread


DJabberd::ClusterMessage  (IQ-style tagged message/response)
  -- must serialize itself to/from storable and Cluster's transport can choose to encode atop that.

  DJabberd::ClusterMessage::RosterPush       response = OK
  DJabberd::ClusterMessage::BareJIDLookup    response = @locations
  DJabberd::ClusterMessage::StanzaDelivery   response = OK
