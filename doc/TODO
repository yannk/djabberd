cleanup/unifiy callbacks.... error vs. fail, on_data vs set vs loaded, etc...
  give them types?

-- $stanza->process and $stanza->deliver take a $conn, but
   now that stanzas always know their connection, that
   parameter is kinda useless.  remove them all?

-- Jingle/Asterisk stuff:

   This Jabber client supports Jingle:
     http://www.kismith.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/2005/12/16/i-say-i-say-i-say-did-you-hear-the-one-about/
     http://psi-im.org/wiki/Jingle_branch
   So think we could do the Jingle stuff Jabber-server-side and get the Psi
   client connecting to Asterisk over SIP or something? 

-- invites on next connect
-- and don't send rosteritems with that incoming bit on

-- iChat "wants to add you as a buddy!" forever bug.  do we not say subscribed back?  state is both/both when this happens.
