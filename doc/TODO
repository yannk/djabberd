cleanup/unifiy callbacks.... error vs. fail, on_data vs set vs loaded, etc...
  give them types?

-- mart introduced CNAME support, but it can recurse forever.

-- debian install guide.

-- debian packaging

-- make SSL configuration easier:  configurable locations of keys,
   and bitch if configured and not configured

-- $stanza->process and $stanza->deliver take a $conn, but
   now that stanzas always know their connection, that
   parameter is kinda useless.  remove them all?
     -- actually, we should also store a non-weak vhost ref
        in stanzas, then use that for delivery/etc, since
        conn as a weakref can go away if client disconnects
        and we may still want to process/deliver.

-- Jingle/Asterisk stuff:

   This Jabber client supports Jingle:
     http://www.kismith.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/2005/12/16/i-say-i-say-i-say-did-you-hear-the-one-about/
     http://psi-im.org/wiki/Jingle_branch
   So think we could do the Jingle stuff Jabber-server-side and get the Psi
   client connecting to Asterisk over SIP or something? 

-- invites on next connect
-- and don't send rosteritems with that incoming bit on

-- iChat "wants to add you as a buddy!" forever bug.  do we not say subscribed back?  state is both/both when this happens.

-- speed up XMLElement as_xml ... try to reuse the original scalarref read from the network, if
   we can align the boundaries of XML stanzas to network reads.  XML::Parser::Expat can help
   us:  (where $self->{parser} is our incremental parser)

    print Dumper("eobj = " . eval { $self->{parser}->_expat_obj->current_byte });
    $VAR1 = 'eobj = 22';


-- when a server goes away, we still have a queue for it and don't reestablish connections with it
   send message from server a to server b, kill server a, start it again
   now messages can from a to b but not from b to a


-- <not-authorized/> -- the sender must provide proper credentials
      before being allowed to perform the action, or has provided
      improper credentials; the associated error type SHOULD be "auth".   no error currently gets sent on non AUTH

-- being booted with invalid-from stream error as a result of some s2s vcard IQ stuff:
